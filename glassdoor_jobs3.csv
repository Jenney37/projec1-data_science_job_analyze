Data Scientist,$97K - $141K (Glassdoor Est.),"Overview:
Systems Planning and Analysis Australia Pty Ltd (SPA Australia) provides operational analysis and decision support services to the Department of Defence. We draw on a range of data and information sources in order to generate information-rich, user-friendly products that provide insights and recommendations to enhance Defence capability. SPA Australia is growing Australia's sovereign capability through local upskilling of its workforce by drawing on processes and tools used by our parent company SPA US, which has supported the US Department of Defense for the past 49 years. We provide formal and informal training opportunities for our team members.

SPA has a near-term need for a Junior Data Scientist/Analyst to work within a small, highly specialised team to collate, wrangle, transform, analyse and visualise a diverse range of sensitive data in support of specific current and future Navy capabilities.
Responsibilities:
Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At SPA, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works” in order to generate insights and recommendations to improve operational effectiveness and other outcomes.

We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you will fit in well with our multi-disciplined team of analysts.

We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we will spend a lot of time combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modelling happen. This allows the data to be processed, analysed and visualised prior to further analysis being undertaken by domain experts in order to generate actionable insights and recommendations for Navy. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.
Qualifications:
Required Qualifications:
Bachelor’s degree in data science, data analytics, software engineering, or related STEM field.
Experience conducting data analysis and assessments and presenting results. Strong communication skills, both verbal and written.
Strong analytic curiosity, attention to detail, and the desire to learn and apply new skills in support of Navy capabilities
Ability to work well within a team environment alongside technical and operational specialists
Ability to get and maintain a Positive Vetting (PV) Australian Defence security clearance. Applicants must be eligible to obtain and maintain an appropriate Australian security clearance. More information on eligibility for an Australian security clearance can be found at: https://www.defence.gov.au/security/clearances/about/vetting-assessment#eligibility.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and/or Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are applicable to this role and as such, the position will or is likely to require access to material controlled by ITAR and EAR (Controlled Material). Therefore, any person occupying the position must be able to satisfy ITAR and EAR controls, which may require specific authorisation to access Controlled Materials. Accordingly, your citizenship, previous citizenships, race or nationality, or substantive contacts where such contacts are affiliated with proscribed countries under ITAR may be a factor in determining your suitability for this role. Further information on this requirement can be found at: https://spa.com/about/compliance-statements/. If you are concerned about whether you will satisfy the requirements of the role insofar as they relate to ITAR and EAR, you should contact SPA Recruiting at recruiting@spa.com, who will be able to provide you with relevant information.

Scottsdale - TAS


The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;
Maintain professional scientific standards and currency in food science capabilities, including food safety, nutrient stability and fortification, advances in food ingredients, processing and packaging technologies, where the focus is on extending the life of shelf-stable foods;
Understand, select and conduct specialised analytical testing on food and packaging solutions in order to demonstrate and validate their ability to provide optimal solutions to identified problems;
Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate
Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes. You value strong trust-based relationships and stakeholder engagement and are willing to share and receive learnings and support of/to others. You will be a proven communicator at a technical and non-technical level. To be successful you will require academic qualifications in one or more relevant areas of food science and/or equivalent demonstrated research skills and work experience appropriate to the duties of this position.

Interested in building and executing geospatial analytics on top of millions of square kilometres of aerial imagery working closely with key property insurance customers? Nearmap is recruiting for a mid-level Data Scientist to join the AI Output Systems team within the AI Systems group.

Company Description:
Nearmap is a Sydney-based global location intelligence company. We have tens of petabytes of high quality aerial imagery covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery dating back to 2009. We produce automated 3D models of entire cities, and rich AI-driven vector maps, which turns our visual content into semantic information to power decisions in a wide range of organisations.

In the AI Output Systems team we design, build, and operate software systems that transform aerial imagery to insight. Our technology stack is based on the Python scientific libraries and traverses deep learning technology such as Tensorflow and Pytorch, cloud native technology such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow and Kafka, and computational geometry / GIS tools such as the Shapely and GeoPandas libraries.

Nearmap is a high-growth company, the ideal candidate will embrace an environment where things happen quickly and continuously. We aim for all employees to feel supported in their career development, with an abundance of opportunities for mentorship and cross-functional team projects.

We need our engineers to be collaborative, versatile, innovative team members with an enthusiasm for best practice, as we continue to push technology forward. We embrace diversity and encourage minority candidates to apply.

A typical day will look like this:
Work within a team to deliver end-to-end technical solutions — typically starting with spike sessions, onto architectural design and test creation, iteration on the solution, measuring quality and ultimately deploying to production.
Participation in the design and scoping of greenfield projects, including customer exploration sessions.
Commitment to best practices and a strong culture of peer review.

Qualifications

We are after an exceptional candidate, who has real world experience but is still eager to innovate and learn.

Essential:
Programming/Tech Environments: Ability to code in scientific Python, using a Linux environment and industry best practices such as a keen eye for clean code and a passion for robustness and correctness.

Computer Vision: ML techniques applied to image data.
Tabular Data: generating predictive models from structured and unstructured data including time series analysis.
Working with large data sets, where data sets don’t fit into memory, and require multiple nodes to compute efficiently.
GIS: Knowledge of geospatial tools and techniques at continental scale.

Personal attributes:
Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of theory and best practices are highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: data science is a team sport, communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills.

Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.

We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques. We are backed by leading venture-capital funds and major research and technology institutes.

Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Our unique vision is to make quantum computing available as an everyday technology, from data centres to remote and mobile systems like autonomous robots and satellites. In contrast to quantum computers that fill a room, we are developing quantum accelerators with more compute power than a classical supercomputer but a form-factor smaller than a lunchbox.
We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques. We are backed by leading venture-capital funds and major research and technology institutes.

Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

We are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!

Our unique vision is to make quantum computing available as an everyday technology, from data centres to remote and mobile systems like autonomous robots and satellites. In contrast to quantum computers that fill a room, we are developing quantum accelerators with more compute power than a classical supercomputer but a form-factor smaller than a lunchbox.
We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques.

Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Our unique vision is to make quantum computing available as an everyday technology, from data centres to remote and mobile systems like autonomous robots and satellites. In contrast to quantum computers that fill a room, we are developing quantum accelerators with more compute power than a classical supercomputer but a form-factor smaller than a lunchbox.
We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques. We are backed by leading venture-capital funds and major research and technology institutes.
About the role:
We are interested to hear from people with a broad range of backgrounds and career stages, whether you have recently finished your PhD, are a senior postdoc or research group leader running your own projects, or are working in a technical industry role.

Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.
Experience in technical leadership of projects, independently defining and solving problems.
Ability to set priorities to accomplish multiple tasks within deadlines, and adapt to rapidly changing needs.
Excellent communication and teamwork skills, able to articulate ideas that can be understood by others.
In your application, please include both your key technical skills as well as details of any of your publications you would like to highlight. Examples of relevant technical skillsets:

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

"Quantum Researcher, Experiment (all levels)",$36K - $96K (Glassdoor Est.),"Quantum Brilliance is the world leader in room-temperature quantum computing using synthetic diamonds. Our unique vision is to make quantum computing available as an everyday technology, from data centres to remote and mobile systems like autonomous robots and satellites. In contrast to quantum computers that fill a room, we are developing quantum accelerators with more compute power than a classical supercomputer but a form-factor smaller than a lunchbox.
We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques. We are backed by leading venture-capital funds and major research and technology institutes.
About the role:
We are interested to hear from people with a broad range of backgrounds and career stages, whether you have recently finished your PhD, are a senior postdoc or research group leader running your own projects, or are working in a technical industry role. We will tailor the role (and remuneration) to your career stage and expertise, matched to particular goals we need to hit.
Quantum device design, and tabletop experiments using research diamonds from our Materials unit, testing new qubit architectures, developing and characterising control methods, and exploring the scaling of qubit number.
Controlling complex systems of electronic and nuclear spins.
Designing and testing micro- and nanofabricated optical and electronic control structures.
Benchmarking, understanding and pushing the limits of performance, on both tabletop and product-prototype systems
Implementing quantum algorithms and state of the art quantum benchmarking protocols.
Applying advanced quantum sensing protocols to characterise the qubit noise environment.
Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.
Experience in technical leadership of projects, independently defining and solving problems.
Ability to set priorities to accomplish multiple tasks within deadlines, and adapt to rapidly changing needs.
Excellent communication and teamwork skills, able to articulate ideas that can be understood by others.
In your application, please include both your key technical skills as well as details of any of your publications you would like to highlight. Examples of relevant technical skillsets:
Demonstrated research leadership in NV centres in diamond or similar spin-based quantum systems (e.g. atoms, ions, solid-state defects).

Experience in design and characterisation of quantum devices
Design and experimental testing of nano/microelectronics for qubit control
Design (e.g. using Lumerical) and experimental testing of integrated optics (micro- and nano-structures).
RF and microwave electronics (1-20 MHz, 1-30 GHz), including arbitrary waveform generation, mixers, amplifiers, and near-field antennas.
Experiment control systems: analogue and digital I/O, software control of hardware.
Research-grade laser-optics systems, e.g. confocal microscopes.
Diamond processing: cleaning, etching, NV creation.
Clean-room process and workflow development, e.g. EBL, UV-lithography, and deposition techniques.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

We are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!

Scottsdale - TAS


The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;
Maintain professional scientific standards and currency in food science capabilities, including food safety, nutrient stability and fortification, advances in food ingredients, processing and packaging technologies, where the focus is on extending the life of shelf-stable foods;
Understand, select and conduct specialised analytical testing on food and packaging solutions in order to demonstrate and validate their ability to provide optimal solutions to identified problems;
Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate
Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes. You value strong trust-based relationships and stakeholder engagement and are willing to share and receive learnings and support of/to others. You will be a proven communicator at a technical and non-technical level. To be successful you will require academic qualifications in one or more relevant areas of food science and/or equivalent demonstrated research skills and work experience appropriate to the duties of this position.

Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Scottsdale - TAS


The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;
Maintain professional scientific standards and currency in food science capabilities, including food safety, nutrient stability and fortification, advances in food ingredients, processing and packaging technologies, where the focus is on extending the life of shelf-stable foods;
Understand, select and conduct specialised analytical testing on food and packaging solutions in order to demonstrate and validate their ability to provide optimal solutions to identified problems;
Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate
Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes. You value strong trust-based relationships and stakeholder engagement and are willing to share and receive learnings and support of/to others. You will be a proven communicator at a technical and non-technical level. To be successful you will require academic qualifications in one or more relevant areas of food science and/or equivalent demonstrated research skills and work experience appropriate to the duties of this position.

Our unique vision is to make quantum computing available as an everyday technology, from data centres to remote and mobile systems like autonomous robots and satellites. In contrast to quantum computers that fill a room, we are developing quantum accelerators with more compute power than a classical supercomputer but a form-factor smaller than a lunchbox.
We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques. We are backed by leading venture-capital funds and major research and technology institutes.
About the role:
We are interested to hear from people with a broad range of backgrounds and career stages, whether you have recently finished your PhD, are a senior postdoc or research group leader running your own projects, or are working in a technical industry role.

Implementing quantum algorithms and state of the art quantum benchmarking protocols.
Applying advanced quantum sensing protocols to characterise the qubit noise environment.
Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.
Experience in technical leadership of projects, independently defining and solving problems.
Ability to set priorities to accomplish multiple tasks within deadlines, and adapt to rapidly changing needs.
Excellent communication and teamwork skills, able to articulate ideas that can be understood by others.
In your application, please include both your key technical skills as well as details of any of your publications you would like to highlight. Examples of relevant technical skillsets:
Demonstrated research leadership in NV centres in diamond or similar spin-based quantum systems (e.g. atoms, ions, solid-state defects).

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

We are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!

Scottsdale - TAS


The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;
Maintain professional scientific standards and currency in food science capabilities, including food safety, nutrient stability and fortification, advances in food ingredients, processing and packaging technologies, where the focus is on extending the life of shelf-stable foods;
Understand, select and conduct specialised analytical testing on food and packaging solutions in order to demonstrate and validate their ability to provide optimal solutions to identified problems;
Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate
Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes. You value strong trust-based relationships and stakeholder engagement and are willing to share and receive learnings and support of/to others. You will be a proven communicator at a technical and non-technical level. To be successful you will require academic qualifications in one or more relevant areas of food science and/or equivalent demonstrated research skills and work experience appropriate to the duties of this position.

"Quantum Researcher, Experiment (all levels)",$106K - $120K (Employer Est.),"Quantum Brilliance is the world leader in room-temperature quantum computing using synthetic diamonds. Our unique vision is to make quantum computing available as an everyday technology, from data centres to remote and mobile systems like autonomous robots and satellites. In contrast to quantum computers that fill a room, we are developing quantum accelerators with more compute power than a classical supercomputer but a form-factor smaller than a lunchbox.
We are a full-stack Australian-German quantum computing company, led and supported by the pioneers of diamond quantum information processing. Our HQs are in Canberra and Stuttgart, with additional locations across Australia and southern Germany. We are working with global technology leaders to develop quantum computing applications, integrate quantum with high-performance computing, solve materials science challenges and develop ultra-precise semiconductor manufacturing and control techniques. We are backed by leading venture-capital funds and major research and technology institutes.
About the role:
We are interested to hear from people with a broad range of backgrounds and career stages, whether you have recently finished your PhD, are a senior postdoc or research group leader running your own projects, or are working in a technical industry role. We will tailor the role (and remuneration) to your career stage and expertise, matched to particular goals we need to hit.

Implementing quantum algorithms and state of the art quantum benchmarking protocols.
Applying advanced quantum sensing protocols to characterise the qubit noise environment.
Developing and testing control methods (optimal, robust etc).
Hardware debugging and hacking. Working with other teams to develop next-gen solutions with improved performance.
Developing and optimising control software and instrumentation tools to accelerate our R&D efforts, e.g. confocal and widefield microscopes, electronics boards, or home-built lasers.
Further details about an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance are described below.
Quantum Brilliance can provide generous relocation support, and support with securing a suitable Australian visa, including pathways to immediate Australian Permanent Residency. It can also be possible to start work with QB remotely, whilst the visa and relocation process proceeds.
About you:
There are a few essential things we need you to have:

PhD in quantum physics or related discipline (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science...).
3+ years' experience conducting experimental research (can include PhD work).
Demonstrated excellence in whatever you have done
Deep understanding of the relevant theory and experimental implementation.
Ability to critically analyse and respond to information.
Understanding of how the project fit into the bigger picture.
Achieved something amazing.
Growth mind-set that enjoys pace and constantly evolving challenges, with a passion for turning cutting edge science into practical reality.
Experience in technical leadership of projects, independently defining and solving problems.
Ability to set priorities to accomplish multiple tasks within deadlines, and adapt to rapidly changing needs.
Excellent communication and teamwork skills, able to articulate ideas that can be understood by others.
In your application, please include both your key technical skills as well as details of any of your publications you would like to highlight. Examples of relevant technical skillsets:

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Scottsdale - TAS


The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;
Maintain professional scientific standards and currency in food science capabilities, including food safety, nutrient stability and fortification, advances in food ingredients, processing and packaging technologies, where the focus is on extending the life of shelf-stable foods;
Understand, select and conduct specialised analytical testing on food and packaging solutions in order to demonstrate and validate their ability to provide optimal solutions to identified problems;
Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate
Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes. You value strong trust-based relationships and stakeholder engagement and are willing to share and receive learnings and support of/to others. You will be a proven communicator at a technical and non-technical level. To be successful you will require academic qualifications in one or more relevant areas of food science and/or equivalent demonstrated research skills and work experience appropriate to the duties of this position.

Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate

Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

We are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!

The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.


Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.


Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes. You value strong trust-based relationships and stakeholder engagement and are willing to share and receive learnings and support of/to others. You will be a proven communicator at a technical and non-technical level. To be successful you will require academic qualifications in one or more relevant areas of food science and/or equivalent demonstrated research skills and work experience appropriate to the duties of this position.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!
About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;

Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.

About The Food & Nutrition (F&N) Team
Our team consists of a diverse team of Defence scientists who come together to provide impartial food and nutrition-related advice and innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Our mission is to ensure that the nutritional status of ADF personnel is optimal for the achievement of their military tasks across a range of challenging training and operational environments. Our work involves a broad range of F&N science activities, including food processing, food safety systems, new product development, specification writing, food chemistry, microbiology, packaging, supply chain/logistics, sensory and consumer science, nutrition and dietetics.

Our Ideal Candidate
Our ideal candidate will be an optimistic, proactive and highly motivated person who is comfortable working within an agile environment with continually evolving requirements. You will have relevant technical knowledge and/or experience in one or more food science capabilities, which may include food formulation, processing (e.g. retorting) and packaging, food safety, shelf life extension (of shelf-stable foods), nutrient stabilisation and fortification, test and evaluation of food safety and quality, and sensory and consumer science.

You will be able to work productively both as an individual and as a team member. You will be confident in investigating and addressing issues impacting achievement of outcomes.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

About an R&D role with Quantum Brilliance:
At Quantum Brilliance, you'll join a team of experts working to create massive, transformative impact. You'll join a team of problem-solvers, who are curious and driven to understand and master new things. We pride ourselves on a collaborative environment, where we learn from the unique expertise that each person brings, and support the growth of each team member.
Working with bright and engaging colleagues, aligned to a common goal. In many academic settings, there are 1-2 people at most working on a particular project. At Quantum Brilliance, there are more people on your project and closely related topics, creating a vibrant environment with lots to learn and share. It also provides an environment to develop your skills in project management and coordination.
Collaborating with colleagues around the world. We currently have labs in 6 locations across Australia and Germany, and collaborate with leading research institutions and quantum technology companies.
Continuous learning. You're expected to keep pace with the state of the art in the field, reading papers and (virtually) attending conferences. If you're switching fields, you'll need to rapidly get up to speed with the literature history, something we will help with but that you are expected to drive. There are further exciting learnings in project management, team leadership, and business operations.
Research leadership. As you complete projects and build your understanding of the company and its R&D programs, you will be increasingly expected to provide input to help shape roadmaps and targets for subsequent R&D projects. This can include pitching projects to follow-up on discoveries made during previous projects.
Creating IP and patenting your inventions.
Publishing. We'll publish from time to time as a company, including technical white papers and scientific papers targeting top-tier (Nature, Science) journals, with authorship following the usual scientific conventions. In contrast to an academic environment, the publishing is driven by strategic considerations rather than as our primary 'product'.
Conferences and outreach. We provide opportunities for presenting at and/or participating in conferences, workshops and careers events.
Lecturing and teaching. You won't be convening undergrad courses, but you will still have plenty of opportunities to share your knowledge within the team. This can include providing technical leadership and mentoring to other team members, doing projects with brilliant interns, and regular internal technical group meetings.
Research environment. Our labs are co-located with universities or public research institutions, at sites across Australia and Germany.
Applying for grants. Depending on your role with QB and the funding/partnership opportunities, this might still be a thing. But there tends to be a much higher success rate, shorter timelines to funding outcomes, and it's no longer a live-or-die thing for your career.
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; hence we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

We are aware that some individuals tend to only apply for jobs when they meet 100% of the criteria. If you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit!

Scottsdale - TAS


The Role
Do you seek a tree change or an opportunity to earn a big city salary and live the country life? Our ideal candidate will be suited to working on a relatively small Defence site located in Scottsdale, Tasmania. A small rural community - where the air is cleaner, the grass is greener, the food is fresher and nature abounds with serenity and adventure. We will cover all reasonable relocation costs.

We provide opportunities for a long standing career where you can be supported to grow your expertise through on-going formal and informal learning and development activities.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and resourceful food scientist to join our niche team of food scientists, in partnering with academia, Government and industry, to conduct world-class collaborative research and development on shelf-stable foods. You will find creative solutions for complex technical problems across a range of food science and technology fields—investigating, interpreting and transforming knowledge and technology into Defence capabilities. You will have the opportunity to understand challenges, analyse problems and deliver food and feeding solutions with immediate and enduring positive impact to Defence; as well as opportunity for further training and career development.

In your role as a Food Science Researcher you will:
Contribute to the generation and application of new knowledge on food processing technologies, including microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, for industry application in future Defence-specific shelf-stable feeding solutions;
Maintain professional scientific standards and currency in food science capabilities, including food safety, nutrient stability and fortification, advances in food ingredients, processing and packaging technologies, where the focus is on extending the life of shelf-stable foods;
Understand, select and conduct specialised analytical testing on food and packaging solutions in order to demonstrate and validate their ability to provide optimal solutions to identified problems;
Participate in collaborative research with local, national and international academia, industry, Government and military partners;
Communicate research activities and findings to the broader stakeholder and scientific community groups through briefings, formal reports, journal publications and conference presentations.

At times, the role may require significant ‘hands-on’ effort at the laboratory bench and in the food research pilot plant, including preparation, experiment execution and clean-up activities. At times, the role may involve significant desk-based effort to review the literature, analyse data and write reports, and to perform other computer-based tasks. The role also includes experimentation and data collection in military environments, for example during field training exercises.
