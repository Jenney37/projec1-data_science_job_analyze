Join an award-winning team!

Technology has revolutionised the business space and is now more powerful than ever. But with great power comes great responsibility. That’s why we’re here. Part risk, part tech, we help clients protect their intellectual property and data!

Who are we?
Call us biased, but we’re probably the people with the coolest jobs at Deloitte. We help clients navigate tech risks through internal investigations and forensically analysing electronic evidence collected from phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems. Then, we design solutions that help our clients risk-align and future-proof their systems. Pretty cool, right?

What will your typical day look like?
We’ll be honest, it’s hard to tell you what an average day will look like at Deloitte because every day is just so different! Working on projects with an impressive portfolio of top-tier clients, you’ll get enviable experience as you:

Get exposure to tracing data breaches, intellectual property theft, misuse of computer systems and fraudulent activity (such as corruption and money laundering)
Roll up your sleeves to investigate electronic evidence collected from mobile phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems
Design solutions for engagements relating to electronic discovery, forensic investigations, legal support and digital forensics
Explore and identify patterns in data to underpin decisions and outcomes for clients

Technology has revolutionised the business space and is now more powerful than ever. But with great power comes great responsibility. That’s why we’re here. Part risk, part tech, we help clients protect their intellectual property and data!

Call us biased, but we’re probably the people with the coolest jobs at Deloitte.
